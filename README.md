# cpp-learning
This is a github repo where I am going to be putting all the material I used for learning so it can serve as a guide to people also studying OOP on FTN;

I will be writing in english since I don't believe in coding in Serbian :);

The files will be organized into groups by level and I will try to follow the pace of the proffessor;

Also, if you want to help, either if u find an error or want to write an example since those are going to take a while, feel free to email me or write an issue :);
